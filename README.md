# QMK Planck Keymaps

These are my keymaps for my planck ez and my planck rev 6 (bought via massdrop).  
They are compiled and tested with qmk version 1.1.5.


## Layers

 - QWERTY
   This is the main layer, contains no real changes from the default IIRC.
 - LOWER
   A bit modified from the default, Im using it for my programmings symbols '(' and ')', '[' and ']', (shift '{' and '}'), and 
   for music control, play/pause, vol up and vol down
 - RAISE
   Not really different from the default, also used for just a few symbols
 - ADJUST
   Used for swedish characters and changing input between linux and emacs.
 - ARROWS
   Pretty self explanatory, I, like to have my arrow keys in a pyramid shape, also for PG UP/DOWN and home/end
 - NUMS
   Emulating a numpad but starting with 1 in the upper left corner. Much like the keypads for entering the code when opening a gate.
 - FBTNS
   F-buttons in a 4x3 grid to the left.
   
   I've disabled the music on both my keyboards and no annoying leds. 


## To fix
I'm sure there's a bunch of dead/unused code in my keymaps but for now they do what I need them to do.  
I will fix the layout sometime in the future to make it a bit more logical and thought through. But in the end
theres just no need for it, my muscle memory trumps a lot of the cognitive errors in the layout.
